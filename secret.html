<p>My favorite mousey! I miss mousey. Little mouse. I miss mousey.
    Sometimes, I feel like I'm in trouble for no reason. I miss mice.
    I miss mice. I miss mice. And rats. And love. and being human.
    <br>and.
<br>no. That's kind of worthless, right? I'm a little mousey!
<br>That's lame to say.
<br>I'm a mousey. I'm a good boy. I'm a rat. I'm a good boy. I'm a little rat.
